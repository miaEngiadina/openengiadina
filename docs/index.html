<h1 class="title">openEngiadina</h1>

<p>openEngiadina is a platform for creating, publishing and using open local knowledge.</p>
<h1 id="overview"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Overview</h1>
<h2 id="local-knowledge"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Local Knowledge</h2>
<p>There are thousands of little pieces of information and data that describe the social, cultural and natural environment of an area, we call such data local knowledge.</p>
<p>Local knowledge may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>points of interest (e.g. a mineral spring)</li>
<li>social and cultural activities (e.g. a concert)</li>
<li>descriptions for outdoor activities (e.g. hiking routes or snow reports)</li>
<li>local businesses (e.g. a book shop, a bakery or a hotel)</li>
<li>classifieds (e.g. somebody wants to sell a bicycle)</li>
</ul>
<p>Local knowledge is produced and used by various people and organizations (actors). Actors that may interact with openEngiadina include:</p>
<ul>
<li>locals: be informed on social and cultural activities, publish a classified</li>
<li>local businesses: publish information about their business</li>
<li>cultural and social organizations: announce events</li>
<li>tourists: discover activities and places to visit</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="open-knowledge"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Open Knowledge</h2>
<p>We believe that <em>local knowledge</em> should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, local knowledge needs to be <a href="https://opendefinition.org/">open data</a>. However, having access to data is not enough. Data needs to be accessible (useful and efficiently useable). Local Knowledge needs to be <a href="https://okfn.org/opendata/">open knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>Technically local knowledge is made open and accessible by describing it as <em>linked data</em>.</p>
<h2 id="crowdsourcing-and-decentralization"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Crowdsourcing and decentralization</h2>
<p>The vast amount of diverse data points that comprise local knowledge make local knowledge practically impossible to centrally manage or control. We observe that the various actors themselves need the means to publish data (e.g. a local book store can publish its changed opening times without appealing to any central authority). Note that large tech giants also rely on individual actors to publish data in <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data">a structured way</a>.</p>
<p>Local knowledge can be expressed in an accessible way as <em>linked data</em>. The <em>ActivityPub</em> protocol provides the means to publish such knowledge in a decentralized manner. Additionally the ActivityPub protocol allows for social interactions such as commenting on pieces of knowledge, liking them or sharing them - features well known from popular social networks.</p>
<h2 id="open-development"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Open Development</h2>
<p>openEngiadina is not only meant to be useable by a wide population but should encourage development of the platform itself and applications interfacing with it. In particular openEngiadina should be useable for projects at local schools and hackatons.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by:</p>
<ul>
<li>using open standards, protocols and software</li>
<li>releasing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">free and open-source software</a></li>
<li>providing adequate documentation</li>
<li>development environment can be set up with minimal requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Some ideas for extensions or applications using openEngiadina include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Augmented Reality using local knowledge</li>
<li>Gamification</li>
<li>Bridges to import data from existing sources</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="objectives"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Objectives</h2>
<p>The objectives of the project, ideas and current work-in-progress is documented <a href="./objectives.html">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="standards-protocols-and-existing-technology"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Standards, protocols and existing technology</h1>
<h2 id="linked-data"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Linked Data</h2>
<p>Knowledge may be represented as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_network">graph</a> consisting of vertices which represent things and edges which represent relations between things. To make this consistent and machine-understandable it is important to name everything (things and relations) so that semantically same things (and relations) can be identified across different sets of data.</p>
<p>A clever convention is to use internet addresses (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URIs</a>) as names and place data about the thing at its URI. Now things can be referred to by their URI and data about the thing can be retrieved by simply looking up the URI. This allows data that is published in different places on the internet to be linked together and to be used very efficiently by machines, this is the core idea of <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">linked data</a>.</p>
<p>Large collections of names and rules (schemas) for describing plenty of things <a href="https://schema.org/">are already defined</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/mark-up-content">widely</a> <a href="https://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/marking-up-your-site-with-structured-data-3a93e731">used</a>. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data#Datasets">many existing linked data sets</a> (e.g. <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a>).</p>
<p>openEngiadina primarly uses the <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> format to represent linked data.</p>
<h2 id="activitypub"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> ActivityPub</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> is an open and decentralized protocol for distributed publishing and social networking. It resembles traditional e-mail in the sense that actors (persons, organizations or bots) have accounts on servers of their choice and can publish messages to other actors (who might be on different servers). The protocol handles delivery of the messages to the recipient actors. Unlike e-mail the messages are structured data, <em>linked data</em>.</p>
<p>The structure of the messages is defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityStream</a> standard. Messages are activities such as creating, updating, deleting, liking or sharing an object. ActivityStream is serialized as JSON-LD and objects can be any <em>linked data</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/741218/">Historically</a> the ActivityPub protocol was born out of improvements to <a href="https://ostatus.github.io/spec/OStatus%201.0%20Draft%202.html">previous protocols</a> for federated social networking.</p>
<h3 id="fediverse"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Fediverse</h3>
<p>A number of services already exist implementing the ActivityPub protocol for federation. That is content from one service is available on an other (provided the client can display the content). The universe of these federated services is called the <em>fediverse</em>. openEngiadina will be part of the fediverse.</p>
<p>Some existing services:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>: federated microblogging platform</li>
<li><a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a>: decentralized video hosting network</li>
<li><a href="https://writefreely.org/">WriteFreely</a>: platform for federated blogging</li>
<li><a href="https://friendi.ca/">friendica</a>: decentralized social network</li>
<li><a href="https://pixelfed.org/">PixelFed</a>: federated image sharing</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://the-federation.info/">Currently there are</a> almost 3 million users on the fediverse spread out on 4'500 servers.</p>
