openEngiadina is a platform for creating, publishing and using open local knowledge.

* Overview
** Local Knowledge

There are thousands of little pieces of information and data that describe the social, cultural and natural environment of an area, we call such data local knowledge.

Local knowledge may include:
 - points of interest (e.g. a mineral spring)
 - social and cultural activities (e.g. a concert)
 - descriptions for outdoor activities (e.g. hiking routes or snow reports)
 - local businesses (e.g. a book shop, a bakery or a hotel)
 - classifieds (e.g. somebody wants to sell a bicycle)

Local knowledge is produced and used by various people and organizations (actors). Actors that may interact with openEngiadina include:
 - locals: be informed on social and cultural activities, publish a classified
 - local businesses: publish information about their business
 - cultural and social organizations: announce events
 - tourists: discover activities and places to visit

** Open Knowledge

We believe that [[*Local Knowledge][local knowledge]] should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, local knowledge needs to be [[https://opendefinition.org/][open data]]. However, having access to data is not enough. Data needs to be accessible (useful and efficiently useable). Local Knowledge needs to be [[https://okfn.org/opendata/][open knowledge]].

Technically local knowledge is made open and accessible by describing it as [[*Linked Data][linked data]].

** Crowdsourcing

The vast amount of diverse data points that comprise local knowledge make local knowledge practically impossible to centrally manage or control. We observe that the various actors themselves need the means to publish data (e.g. a local book store can publish its changed opening times without appealing to any central authority). Note that large tech giants also rely on individual actors to publish data in [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data][a structured way]].

Local knowledge can be expressed in an accessible way as [[*Linked Data][linked data]]. The [[*ActivityPub][ActivityPub]] protocol provides the means to publish such knowledge in a decentralized manner. Additionally the ActivityPub protocol allows for social interactions such as commenting on pieces of knowledge, liking them or sharing them - features well known from popular social networks.

*** Example: Publishing an event

Currently the Engadin tourism office offers an [[https://www.engadin.com/de/veranstaltung-erfassen][online form]] for submitting a new event. The form causes an e-mail to be sent to a content manager working for the tourism office. The data is manually checked and then uploaded to the database of a commercial service provider. Finally the event is retrieved from the commercial service provider and displayed as plain text with minimal markup on the online event calendar.

With openEngiadina the user or local organization creates the event trough a interface similar to one offered by popular social network platforms. The tourism office is notified about the creation immediately and can tag the created event for publishing, this is very similar to "liking" an event. The online event calendar is generated by querying for all events that have been "liked" by the tourism organization. The event can be published almost instantenously, openEngiadina can be used as a crowdsourced content management system. Further advantages include:

- Users can mark that they are attending the event (this might cause the event to show up in their personal calendars).
- The creator of the event can update the event and add more information as it becomes available.
- Website can be generated with semantic data. For examle the location of the event can be used to create a map of all events or an special link can be displayed on the website allowing a user to add the event to their personal calendar.

A more complex example might be status of hiking trails. Currently, publishing changes in status of trails requires a high level of coordination between various public services, the commune and the tourism office. openEngiadina might be able to simplify the work flow for handling status of trails by acknowledging the fact that publishing such data is mostly a social endeavor.

** Open Development

openEngiadina is not only meant to be useable by a wide population but should encourage development of the platform itself and applications interfacing with it. In particular openEngiadina should be useable for projects at local schools and hackatons.

This is accomplished by:
- using open standards, protocols and software
- releasing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software][free and open-source software]]
- providing adequate documentation
- development environment can be set up with minimal requirements

Some ideas for extensions or applications using openEngiadina include:
- Augmented Reality using local knowledge
- Gamification
- Bridges to import data from existing sources

** Objectives
The objectives of the project, ideas and current work-in-progress is documented [[./objectives.html][here]].
* Standards, protocols, existing technology and projects
** Linked Data

Knowledge may be represented as a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_network][graph]] consisting of vertices which represent things and edges which represent relations between things. To make this consistent and machine-understandable it is important to name everything (things and relations) so that semantically same things (and relations) can be identified across different sets of data. 

A clever convention is to use internet addresses ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier][URIs]]) as names and place data about the thing at its URI. Now things can be referred to by their URI and data about the thing can be retrieved by simply looking up the URI. This allows data that is published in different places on the internet to be linked together and to be used very efficiently by machines, this is the core idea of [[https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html][linked data]].

Large collections of names and rules (schemas) for describing plenty of things [[https://schema.org/][are already defined]] and [[https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/mark-up-content][widely]] [[https://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/marking-up-your-site-with-structured-data-3a93e731][used]]. There are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data#Datasets][many existing linked data sets]] (e.g. [[https://www.wikidata.org/][Wikidata]]).

openEngiadina primarly uses the [[https://json-ld.org/][JSON-LD]] format to represent linked data.

*** Triplestore

openEngiadina uses a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore][Triplestore]] as underlying database allowing for highly optimized semantic queries. This is a key novelty and technical challenge of the project. Most existing projects use a relational database.

Initial experiments on how to use a Triplestore [[https://github.com/miaEngiadina/ap-rdr][have been conducted]].

** ActivityPub

[[https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/][ActivityPub]] is an open and decentralized protocol for distributed publishing and social networking. It resembles traditional e-mail in the sense that actors (persons, organizations or bots) have accounts on servers of their choice and can publish messages to other actors (who might be on different servers). The protocol handles delivery of the messages to the recipient actors. Unlike e-mail the messages are structured data, [[*Linked Data][linked data]]. 

The structure of the messages is defined in the [[https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/][ActivityStream]] standard. Messages are activities such as creating, updating, deleting, liking or sharing an object. ActivityStream is serialized as JSON-LD and objects can be any [[*Linked Data][linked data]].

[[https://lwn.net/Articles/741218/][Historically]] the ActivityPub protocol was born out of improvements to [[https://ostatus.github.io/spec/OStatus%201.0%20Draft%202.html][previous protocols]] for federated social networking.

*** Fediverse

A number of services already exist implementing the ActivityPub protocol for federation. That is content from one service is available on an other (provided the client can display the content). The universe of these federated services is called the /fediverse/. openEngiadina will be part of the fediverse.

Some existing services:
- [[https://joinmastodon.org/][Mastodon]]: federated microblogging platform
- [[https://joinpeertube.org/][PeerTube]]: decentralized video hosting network
- [[https://writefreely.org/][WriteFreely]]: platform for federated blogging
- [[https://friendi.ca/][friendica]]: decentralized social network
- [[https://pixelfed.org/][PixelFed]]: federated image sharing

[[https://the-federation.info/][Currently there are]] almost 3 million users on the fediverse spread out on 4'500 servers.
